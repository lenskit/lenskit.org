The dynamic environment forces us to plan our time with conscious and every minute is valuable. To help individuals and corporations see information that is only relevant to them, recommendation systems are in place. Popular platforms that such as Amazon, Ebay, Netflix, YouTube, make use of advanced recommendation systems to better serve the needed of their users. This research paper gives insight of building a microservice recommendation system for online news. Research in recommendation systems is mainly focused on improving user's experience based mainly on personalization information, such as preferences, and searching history. To determine the initial preferences of a user an initial menu of topics/themes is provided for the user to choose from. In order to reflect as precise as possible the searching interests regarding news of user, all of his interactions are thoroughly recorded and in depth analyzed, based on advanced machine learning techniques, when adjusting the news topics, the user is interested for. Based on the aforementioned approach, a personalized recommendation system for online news has been developed. Existing techniques has been researched and evaluated to aid the decision about picking the best approach for the software to be implemented. Frameworks/technologies used for the development are Java 8, Spring boot, Spring MVC, Maven and MongoDB.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is a key requirement for scientific progress. It allows the reproduction of the works of others, and, as a consequence, to fully trust the reported claims and results. In this work, we argue that, by facilitating reproducibility of recommender systems experimentation, we indirectly address the issues of accountability and transparency in recommender systems research from the perspectives of practitioners, designers, and engineers aiming to assess the capabilities of published research works. These issues have become increasingly prevalent in recent literature. Reasons for this include societal movements around intelligent systems and artificial intelligence striving towards fair and objective use of human behavioral data (as in Machine Learning, Information Retrieval, or Human-Computer Interaction). Society has grown to expect explanations and transparency standards regarding the underlying algorithms making automated decisions for and around us. This work surveys existing definitions of these concepts, and proposes a coherent terminology for recommender systems research, with the goal to connect reproducibility to accountability. We achieve this by introducing several guidelines and steps that lead to reproducible and, hence, accountable experimental workflows and research. We additionally analyze several instantiations of recommender system implementations available in the literature, and discuss the extent to which they fit in the introduced framework. With this work, we aim to shed light on this important problem, and facilitate progress in the field by increasing the accountability of research.},

Collaborative and content-based filtering are two basic approaches that are used in recommender systems. The former employs the feedback of users with similar interests, while the latter is based on the feature of the selected resources by each user. Recommender systems can consider users' behavior to more accurately estimate their preferences via a list of recommendations. However, the existing approaches rarely consider both interests and preferences of the users. Also, the dynamic nature of user behavior poses an additional challenge for recommender systems. In this paper, we consider the interactions of each individual user, and analyze them to propose a user model and capture user's interests. We construct the user model based on a Bayesian nonparametric framework, called the Dirichlet Process Mixture Model. The proposed model evolves following the dynamic nature of user behavior to adapt both the user interests and preferences. We implemented the proposed model and evaluated it using both the MovieLens dataset, and a real-world dataset that contains news tweets from five news channels (New York Times, BBC, CNN, Reuters and Associated Press). The experimental results and comparisons with several recently developed approaches show the superiority in accuracy of the proposed approach, and its ability to adapt with user behavior over time.},

  abstract = {Today's systems produce a wealth of data every day, and the data further generates more data, i.e., the derived data, forming into a complex data propagation network, defined as the data's lineage. There are many reasons for users and administrators to forget certain data including the data's lineage. From the privacy perspective, a system may leak private information of certain users, and those users unhappy about privacy leaks naturally want to forget their data and its lineage. From the security perspective, an anomaly detection system can be polluted by adversaries through injecting manually crafted data into the training set. Therefore, we envision forgetting systems, capable of completely forgetting certain data and its lineage. In this paper, we focus on making learning systems forget, the process of which is defined as machine unlearning or unlearning. To perform unlearning upon learning system, we present general unlearning criteria, i.e., converting a learning system or part of it into a summation form of statistical query learning model, and updating all the summations to achieve unlearning. Then, we integrate our unlearning criteria into an unlearning architecture that interacts with all the components of a learning system, such as sample clustering and feature selection. To demonstrate our unlearning criteria and architecture, we select four real-world learning systems, including an item-item recommendation system, an online social network spam filter, and a malware detection system. These systems are first exposed to an adversarial environment, e.g., if the system is potentially vulnerable to training data pollution, we first pollute the training data set and show that the detection rate drops significantly. Then, we apply our unlearning technique upon those affected systems, either polluted or leaking private information. Our results show that after unlearning, the detection rate of a polluted system increases back to the one before pollution, and a system leaking a particular user's private information completely forgets that information.}

For this reason, distinct frameworks have been developed to ease the deployment of RSs in research and/or production environments. In the present work, we perform an extensive study of the most popular evaluation metrics, organizing them into three groups: Effectiveness-based, Complementary Dimensions of Quality and Domain Profiling. Further, we consolidate a framework named FAiR to help researchers in evaluating their RSs using these metrics, besides identifying the characteristics of data collections that may intrinsically affect RSs performance. FAiR is compatible with the output format of the main existing RSs libraries (i.e., MyMediaLite and LensKit).},

  abstract = {Recommender systems, since their introduction 20 years ago, have been widely deployed in web services to alleviate user information overload. Driven by business objectives of their applications, the focus of recommender systems has shifted from accurately modeling and predicting user preferences to offering good personalized user experience. The later is difficult because there are many factors, e.g., tenure of a user, context of recommendation and transparency of recommender system, that affect users' perception of recommendations. Many of these factors are subjective and not easily quantifiable, posing challenges to recommender algorithms. When pure algorithmic solutions are at their limits in providing good user experience in recommender systems, we turn to the collective intelligence of human and computer. Computer and human are complementary to each other: computers are fast at computation and data processing and have accurate memory; humans are capable of complex reasoning, being creative and relating to other humans. In fact, such close collaborations between human and computer have precedent: after chess master Garry Kasparov lost to IBM computer ``Deep Blue'', he invited a new form of chess --- advanced chess, in which human player and a computer program teams up against such pairs. In this thesis, we leverage the collective intelligence of human and computer to tackle several challenges in recommender systems and demonstrate designs of such hybrid systems. We make contributions to the following aspects of recommender systems: providing better new user experience, enhancing topic modeling component for items, composing better recommendation sets and generating personalized natural language explanations. These four applications demonstrate different ways of designing systems with collective intelligence, applicable to domains other than recommender systems. We believe the collective intelligence of human and computer can power more intelligent, user friendly and creative systems, worthy of continuous research effort in future.},

  abstract = {To achieve high quality initial personalization, recommender systems must provide an efficient and effective process for new users to express their preferences. We propose that this goal is best served not by the classical method where users begin by expressing preferences for individual items - this process is an inefficient way to convert a user's effort into improved personalization. Rather, we propose that new users can begin by expressing their preferences for groups of items. We test this idea by designing and evaluating an interactive process where users express preferences across groups of items that are automatically generated by clustering algorithms. We contribute a strategy for recommending items based on these preferences that is generalizable to any collaborative filtering-based system. We evaluate our process with both offline simulation methods and an online user experiment. We find that, as compared with a baseline rate-15-items interface, (a) users are able to complete the preference elicitation process in less than half the time, and (b) users are more satisfied with the resulting recommended items. Our evaluation reveals several advantages and other trade-offs involved in moving from item-based preference elicitation to group-based preference elicitation.}

The aims of this analysis are twofold: (1) to probe the conditions under which common algorithms produce more or less diverse or popular recommendations, and (2) to determine if these personalized recommender algorithms reflect a user's preference for diversity or novelty. We trained recommenders on the MovieLens data and looked for correlation between the user profile and the recommender's output for both diversity and popularity bias using different metrics. We find that the diversity and popularity of movies in users' profiles has little impact on the recommendations they receive.},

  abstract = {Recommender Systems can greatly enhance the exploitation of large digital libraries; however, in order to achieve good accuracy with collaborative recommenders some domain assumptions must be met, such as having a large number of users sharing similar interests over time. Such assumptions may not hold in digital libraries, where users are structured in relatively small groups of experts whose interests may change in unpredictable ways: this is the case of scientific and technical documents archives. Moreover, when recommending documents, users often expect insights on the recommended content as well as a detailed explanation of why the system has selected it, which cannot be provided by collaborative techniques. In this paper we consider the domain of scientific publications repositories and propose a content-based recommender based upon a graph representation of concepts built up by linked keyphrases. This recommender is coupled with a keyphrase extraction system able to generate meaningful metadata for the documents, which are the basis for providing helpful and explainable recommendations.}

In a state of rest, similar measurement results are obtained with the four devices. During physical activities, the fitness tracker, smart watch, and smartphone measure sudden variations in heart rate with a delay, due to movements of the wrist. Moreover, this study showed that physical activities, such as squats and dumbbell curl, can be recognized with fitness trackers.

Recent advances in information retrieval evaluation, however, demonstrate the importance of considering the distribution of effectiveness across diverse groups of varying sizes. For example, do users of different ages or genders obtain similar utility from the system, particularly if their group is a relatively small subset of the user base? We apply this consideration to recommender systems, using offline evaluation and a utility-based metric of recommendation effectiveness to explore whether different user demographic groups experience similar recommendation accuracy. We find demographic differences in measured recommender effectiveness across two data sets containing different types of feedback in different domains; these differences sometimes, but not always, correlate with the size of the user group in question. Demographic effects also have a complex\textemdash and likely detrimental\textemdash interaction with popularity bias, a known deficiency of recommender evaluation. These results demonstrate the need for recommender system evaluation protocols that explicitly quantify the degree to which the system is meeting the information needs of all its users, as well as the need for researchers and operators to move beyond na\"ive evaluations that favor the needs of larger subsets of the user population while ignoring smaller subsets.}

In this work, we examine the response of collaborative filtering recommender algorithms to the distribution of their input data with respect to a dimension of social concern, namely content creator gender. Using publicly-available book ratings data, we measure the distribution of the genders of the authors of books in user rating profiles and recommendation lists produced from this data. We find that common collaborative filtering algorithms differ in the gender distribution of their recommendation lists, and in the relationship of that output distribution to user profile distribution.},

  abstract = {Since the introduction of their modern form 20 years ago, recommender systems have proven a valuable tool for help users manage information overload. Two decades of research have produced many algorithms for computing recommendations, mechanisms for evaluating their effectiveness, and user interfaces and experiences to embody them. It has also been found that the outputs of different recommendation algorithms differ in user-perceptible ways that affect their suitability to different tasks and information needs. However, there has been little work to systematically map out the space of algorithms and the characteristics they exhibit that makes them more or less effective in different applications. As a result, developers of recommender systems must experiment, conducting basic science on each application and its users to determine the approach(es) that will meet their needs. This thesis presents our work towards recommender engineering: the design of recommender systems from well-understood principles of user needs, domain properties, and algorithm behaviors. This will reduce the experimentation required for each new recommender application, allowing developers to design recommender systems that are likely to be effective for their particular application. To that end, we make four contributions: the LensKit toolkit for conducting experiments on a wide variety of recommender algorithms and data sets under different experimental conditions (offline experiments with diverse metrics, online user studies, and the ability to grow to support additional methodologies), along with new developments in object-oriented software configuration to support this toolkit; experiments on the configuration options of widely-used algorithms to provide guidance on tuning and configuring them; an offline experiment on the differences in the errors made by different algorithms; and a user study on the user-perceptible differences between lists of movie recommendations produced by three common recommender algorithms. Much research is needed to fully realize the vision of recommender engineering in the coming years; it is our hope that LensKit will prove a valuable foundation for much of this work, and our experiments represent a small piece of the kinds of studies that must be carried out, replicated, and validated to enable recommender systems to be engineered.},

  abstract = {Top-N evaluation of recommender systems, typically carried out using metrics from information retrieval or machine learning, has several challenges. Two of these challenges are popularity bias, where the evaluation intrinsically favors algorithms that recommend popular items, and misclassified decoys, where items for which no user relevance is known are actually relevant to the user, but the evaluation is unaware and penalizes the recommender for suggesting them. One strategy for mitigating the misclassified decoy problem is the one-plus-random evaluation strategy and its generalization, which we call random decoys. In this work, we explore the random decoy strategy through both a theoretical treatment and an empirical study, but find little evidence to guide its tuning and show that it has complex and deleterious interactions with popularity bias.}

However, it is difficult to compare results from different recommender systems due to the many options in design and implementation of an evaluation strategy. Additionally, algorithm implementations can diverge from the standard formulation due to manual tuning and modifications that work better in some situations. In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks. Our results show the necessity of clear guidelines when reporting evaluation of recommender systems to ensure reproducibility and comparison of results.}

Modern hybridization techniques, such as feature-weighted linear stacking, take advantage of the hypothesis that the relative performance of recommenders varies by circumstance and attempt to optimize each item score to maximize the strengths of the component recommenders. Less attention, however, has been paid to understanding what these strengths and failure modes are. Understanding what causes particular recommenders to fail will facilitate better selection of the component recommenders for future hybrid systems and a better understanding of how individual recommender personalities can be harnessed to improve the recommender user experience. We present an analysis of the predictions made by several well-known recommender algorithms on the MovieLens 10M data set, showing that for many cases in which one algorithm fails, there is another that will correctly predict the rating.},

The collaborative filtering is the most used technique for recommender systems. One of the main components of a recommender system based on the collaborative filtering technique, is the similarity measure used to determine the set of users having the same behavior with regard to the selected items. Several similarity functions have been proposed, with different performances in terms of accuracy and quality of recommendations. In this paper, we propose a new simple and efficient similarity measure. Its mathematical expression is determined through the following paper contributions: 1) transforming some intuitive and qualitative conditions, that should be satisfied by the similarity measure, into relevant mathematical equations namely: the integral equation, the linear system of differential equations and a non-linear system and 2) resolving the equations to achieve the kernel function of the similarity measure. The extensive experimental study driven on a benchmark datasets shows that the proposed similarity measure is very competitive, especially in terms of accuracy, with regards to some representative similarity measures of the literature.},

Recommender systems form a critical component of the business analytics toolkit and, by enabling firms to effectively target customers with products and services, are helping alter the e-commerce landscape. A variety of methods exist for providing recommendations, with collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and association-rule-based methods being the most common. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the quality of recommendations made using association rules. This is accomplished by combining rules when possible and stands apart from existing rule-combination methods in that it is strongly grounded in probability theory. Combining rules requires the identification of the best combination of rules from the many combinations that might exist, and we use a maximum-likelihood framework to compare alternative combinations. Because it is impractical to apply the maximum likelihood framework directly in real time, we show that this problem can equivalently be represented as a set partitioning problem by translating it into an information theoretic context\textemdash the best solution corresponds to the set of rules that leads to the highest sum of mutual information associated with the rules. Through a variety of experiments that evaluate the quality of recommendations made using the proposed approach, we show that (i) a greedy heuristic used to solve the maximum likelihood estimation problem is very effective, providing results comparable to those from using the optimal set partitioning solution; (ii) the recommendations made by our approach are more accurate than those made by a variety of state-of-the-art benchmarks, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization; and (iii) the recommendations can be made in a fraction of a second on a desktop computer, making it practical to use in real-world applications.}

Understanding and predicting preferences is also important from a fundamental point of view, as part of what has been called a ``new'' computational social science. Here, we propose a novel approach based on stochastic block models, which have been developed by sociologists as plausible models of complex networks of social interactions. Our model is in the spirit of predicting individuals' preferences based on the preferences of others but, rather than fitting a particular model, we rely on a Bayesian approach that samples over the ensemble of all possible models. We show that our approach is considerably more accurate than leading recommender algorithms, with major relative improvements between 38\% and 99\% over industry-level algorithms. Besides, our approach sheds light on decision-making processes by identifying groups of individuals that have consistently similar preferences, and enabling the analysis of the characteristics of those groups.}

But typically users are given no explicit control over this personalization, and are instead left guessing about how their actions affect the resulting recommendations. We hypothesize that any recommender algorithm will better fit some users' expectations than others, leaving opportunities for improvement. To address this challenge, we study a recommender that puts some control in the hands of users. Specifically, we build and evaluate a system that incorporates user-tuned popularity and recency modifiers, allowing users to express concepts like "show more popular items". We find that users who are given these controls evaluate the resulting recommendations much more positively. Further, we find that users diverge in their preferred settings, confirming the importance of giving control to users.},

We propose an information theoretic framework for quantifying the preference information contained in ratings and predictions. We computationally explore the properties of our model and apply our framework to estimate the efficiency of different rating scales for real world datasets. We then estimate how the amount of information predictions give to users is related to the scale ratings are collected on. Our findings suggest a tradeoff in rating scale granularity: while previous research indicates that coarse scales (such as thumbs up / thumbs down) take less time, we find that ratings with these scales provide less predictive value to users. We introduce a new measure, preference bits per second, to quantitatively reconcile this tradeoff.},

In this paper, we propose a serendipity-oriented, reranking algorithm called a serendipity-oriented greedy (SOG) algorithm, which improves serendipity of recommendations through feature diversification and helps overcome the overspecialization problem. To evaluate our algorithm, we employed the only publicly available dataset containing user feedback regarding serendipity. We compared our SOG algorithm with topic diversification, popularity baseline, singular value decomposition, serendipitous personalized ranking and Zheng's algorithms relying on the above dataset. SOG outperforms other algorithms in terms of serendipity and diversity. It also outperforms serendipity-oriented algorithms in terms of accuracy, but underperforms accuracy-oriented algorithms in terms of accuracy. We found that the increase of diversity can hurt accuracy and harm or improve serendipity depending on the size of diversity increase.},

Recommender systems are auxiliary systems designed to help users find interesting goods or services (items) on a website when the number of available items is overwhelming. Traditionally, recommender systems have been optimized for accuracy, which indicates how often a user consumed the items recommended by system. To increase accuracy, recommender systems often suggest items that are popular and suitably similar to items these users have consumed in the past. As a result, users often lose interest in using these systems, as they either know about the recommended items already or can easily find these items themselves. One way to increase user satisfaction and user retention is to suggest serendipitous items. These items are items that users would not find themselves or even look for, but would enjoy consuming. Serendipity in recommender systems has not been thoroughly investigated. There is not even a consensus on the concept's definition. In this dissertation, serendipitous items are defined as relevant, novel and unexpected to a user. In this dissertation, we (a) review different definitions of the concept and evaluate them in a user study, (b) assess the proportion of serendipitous items in a typical recommender system, (c) review ways to measure and improve serendipity, (d) investigate serendipity in cross-domain recommender systems (systems that take advantage of multiple domains, such as movies, songs and books) and (e) discuss challenges and future directions concerning this topic. We applied a Design Science methodology as the framework for this study and developed four artifacts: (1) a collection of eight variations of serendipity definition, (2) a measure of the serendipity of suggested items, (3) an algorithm that generates serendipitous suggestions, (4) a dataset of user feedback regarding serendipitous movies in the recommender system MovieLens.

In chapter 4 we look at the relationships between user personality and user preferences for recommendation diversity, popularity, and serendipity. In chapter 5 we investigate the relations between the self-reported user satisfaction and the three recommendation properties with the inferred user recommendation consumption. In chapter 6 we look at four different rating inter- faces and evaluated how these interfaces affected the user rating experience. We find that over time a recommender system exposes users to less-diverse contents and that users rate less-diverse items. However, users who took recommendations were exposed to more diverse recommendations than those who did not. Furthermore, users with different personalities have different preferences for recommendation diversity, popularity, and serendipity (e.g. some users prefer more diverse recommendations, while others prefer similar ones). We also find that user satisfaction with recommendation popularity and serendipity measured with survey questions strongly relate to user recommendation consumption inferred with logged data. We then propose a way to get better signals about user preferences and help users rate items in the recommendation systems more consistently. That is providing exemplars to users at the time they rate the items improved the consistency of users' ratings. Our results suggest several ways recommender system practitioners and re- searchers can enrich the user experience. For example, by integrating users' personality into recommendation frameworks, we can help recommender systems deliver recommendations with the preferred levels of diversity, popularity, and serendipity to individual users. We can also facilitate the rating process by integrating a set of proven rating-support techniques into the systems' interfaces.},

  abstract = {In the era of big data, it is usually agreed that the more data we have, the better results we can get. However, for some domains that heavily depend on user inputs (such as recommender systems), the performance evaluation metrics are sensitive to the amount of noise introduced by users. Such noise can be from users who only wanted to explore the systems, and thus did not spend efforts to provide accurate inputs. Noise can also be introduced by the methods of collecting user ratings. In my dissertation, I study how user data can affect prediction accuracies and performances of recommendation algorithms. To that end, I investigate how the data collection methods and the life cycles of users affect the prediction accuracies and the performance of recommendation algorithms.}

A variety of algorithms for recommender systems have been developed and refined including applications of deep learning neural networks. Recent research reports point to a need to perform carefully controlled experiments to gain insights about the relative accuracy of different recommender algorithms, because studies evaluating different methods have not used a common set of benchmark data sets, baseline models, and evaluation metrics.The dissertation used publicly available sources of ratings data with a suite of three conventional recommender algorithms and two deep learning (DL) algorithms in controlled experiments to assess their comparative accuracy. Results for the non-DL algorithms conformed well to published results and benchmarks. The two DL algorithms did not perform as well and illuminated known challenges implementing DL recommender algorithms as reported in the literature. Model overfitting is discussed as a potential explanation for the weaker performance of the DL algorithms and several regularization strategies are reviewed as possible approaches to improve predictive error. Findings justify the need for further research in the use of deep learning models for recommender systems.},

In this paper, we propose SCoR, a Synthetic Coordinate based Recommendation system which is shown to outperform the most popular algorithmic techniques in the field, approaches like matrix factorization and collaborative filtering. SCoR assigns synthetic coordinates to nodes (users and items), so that the distance between a user and an item provides an accurate prediction of the user's preference for that item. The proposed framework has several benefits. It is parameter free, thus requiring no fine tuning to achieve high performance, and is more resistance to the cold-start problem compared to other algorithms. Furthermore, it provides important annotations of the dataset, such as the physical detection of users and items with common and unique characteristics as well as the identification of outliers. SCoR is compared against nine other state-of-the-art recommender systems, sever of them based on the well known matrix factorization and two on collaborative filtering. The comparison is performed against four real datasets, including a brief version of the dataset used in the well known Netflix challenge. The extensive experiments prove that SCoR outperforms previous techniques while demonstrating its improved stability and high performance.},

Even though online book-exchange systems have been developed, their services can further be improved by reducing the workload imposed on their users. To accomplish this task, we propose a recommendation-based book exchange system, called EasyEx, which identifies potential exchanges for a user solely based on a list of items the user is willing to part with. EasyEx is a novel and unique book-exchange system because unlike existing online exchange systems, it does not require a user to create and maintain a wish list, which is a list of items the user would like to receive as part of the exchange. Instead, EasyEx directly suggests items to users to increase serendipity and as a result expose them to items which may be unfamiliar, but appealing, to them. In identifying books to be exchanged, EasyEx employs known recommendation strategies, that is, personalized mean and matrix factorization, to predict book ratings, which are treated as the degrees of appeal to a user on recommended books. Furthermore, EasyEx incorporates OptaPlanner, which solves constraint satisfaction problems efficiently, as part of the recommendation-based exchange process to create exchange cycles. Experimental results have verified that EasyEx offers users recommended books that satisfy the users' interests and contributes to the item-exchange mechanism with a new design methodology.}

Additional challenges for recommender systems emerge in the domain of tourism such as acquiring metadata and feedback, the sparsity of the rating matrix, user constraints, and the fact that traveling is often a group activity. This paper proposes a recommender system that offers personalized recommendations for travel destinations to individuals and groups. These recommendations are based on the users' rating profile, personal interests, and specific demands for their next destination. The recommendation algorithm is a hybrid approach combining a content-based, collaborative filtering, and knowledge-based solution. For groups of users, such as families or friends, individual recommendations are aggregated into group recommendations, with an additional opportunity for users to give feedback on these group recommendations. A group of test users evaluated the recommender system using a prototype web application. The results prove the usefulness of individual and group recommendations and show that users prefer the hybrid algorithm over each individual technique. This paper demonstrates the added value of various recommendation algorithms in terms of different quality aspects, compared to an unpersonalized list of the most-popular destinations.}

High performance in Java relies on libraries providing explicit threads or relying on runnable-like interfaces for distributed programming. In this thesis, we develop an autotuning framework for JVM that manages multiple objective functions including execution time, power consumption, energy and perfomance-per-watt. The framework searches the combined space of JIT optimization sequences and different classes of JVM runtime parameters. To discover good configurations more quickly, the framework implements novel heuristic search algorithms. To reduce the size of the search space machine-learning based pruning techniques are used. Evaluation on recommender system workloads show that significant improvements in both performance and power can be gained by fine-tuning JVM runitme parameters.},

In this work we compare common recommendation algorithms as implemented in three popular recommendation frameworks. To provide a fair comparison, we have complete control of the evaluation dimensions being benchmarked: dataset, data splitting, evaluation strategies, and metrics. We also include results using the internal evaluation mechanisms of these frameworks. Our analysis points to large differences in recommendation accuracy across frameworks and strategies, i.e. the same baselines may perform orders of magnitude better or worse across frameworks.

These social networks are huge, comprising millions of nodes and edges that push existing graph mining algorithms and architectures to their limits. In product-rating graphs, users connect with each other and rate items in tandem. In such bipartite graphs users and items are the nodes and ratings are the edges and collaborative filtering algorithms use the edge information (i.e. user ratings for items) in order to suggest items of potential interest to users. Existing algorithms can hardly scale up to the size of the entire graph and require unlimited resources to finish. This work employs a machine learning method for predicting the performance of Collaborative Filtering algorithms using the structural features of the bipartite graphs. Using a fast graph partitioning algorithm and information from the user friendship graph, the original bipartite graph is partitioned into different schemes (i.e. sets of smaller bipartite graphs). The schemes are evaluated against the predicted performance of the Collaborative Filtering algorithm and the best partitioning scheme is employed for generating the recommendations. As a result, the Collaborative Filtering algorithms are applied to smaller bipartite graphs, using limited resources and allowing the problem to scale or be parallelized. Tests on a large, real-life, rating graph, show that the proposed method allows the collaborative filtering algorithms to run in parallel and complete using limited resources.},

This parallel algorithm is able to work on partitioned data and is general in that it supports a wide range of similarity measures.

  abstract = {Recommender systems help users to find products they may like when lacking personal experience or facing an overwhelmingly large set of items. However, assessing the quality and stability of recommender systems can present challenges for developers. First, traditional accuracy metrics, such as precision and recall, for validating the quality of recommendations, offer only a coarse, one-dimensional view of the system performance. Second, assessing the stability of a recommender systems requires generating new data and retraining a system, which is expensive. In this work, we present two new approaches for assessing the quality and stability of recommender systems to address these challenges. We first present a general and extensible approach for assessing the quality of the behavior of a recommender system using logical property templates. The approach is general in that it defines recommendation systems in terms of sets of rankings, ratings, users, and items on which property templates are defined. It is extensible in that these property templates define a space of properties that can be instantiated and parameterized to characterize a recommendation system. We study the application of the approach to several recommendation systems. Our findings demonstrate the potential of these properties, illustrating the insights they can provide about the different algorithms and evolving datasets. We also present an approach for influence-guided fuzz testing of recommender system stability. We infer influence models for aspects of a dataset, such as users or items, from the recommendations produced by a recommender system and its training data. We define dataset fuzzing heuristics that use these influence models for generating modifications to an original dataset and we present a test oracle based on a threshold of acceptable instability. We implement our approach and evaluate it on several recommender algorithms using the MovieLens dataset and we find that influence-guided fuzzing can effectively find small sets of modifications that cause significantly more instability than random approaches.

For this we have developed a generic meta-model to capture recommender system configuration parameters in general as well as in a web augmentation context. Thereupon, we have implemented a wizard in the form of an easy-to-use browser plug-in, allowing the generation of so-called user scripts, which are executed in the browser to engage collaborative filtering functionality from a provided external rest service. We discuss functionality and limitations of the approach, and in a study with end-users we assess the usability and show its suitability for combining recommender systems with web augmentation techniques, aiming to empower end-users to implement controllable recommender applications for a more personalized browsing experience.},

Existing studies commonly use rated items (which form only a small section in a rating matrix) or import some additional information (e.g., details about the items and users) to improve the performance of CF. Unlike these methods, we propose a novel notion towards a huge amount of unrated items: serendipity item. By utilizing serendipity items, we propose concise satisfaction and interest injection (CSII), a method that can effectively find interesting, satisfying, and serendipitous items in unrated items. By preventing uninteresting and unsatisfying items to be recommended as top-N items, this concise-but-novel method improves accuracy and recommendation quality (especially serendipity) substantially. Meanwhile, it can address the sparsity and cold-start issues by enriching the rating matrix in CF without additional information. As our method tackles rating matrix before recommendation procedure, it can be applied to most existing CF methods, such as item-based CF, user-based CF and matrix factorization-based CF. Through comprehensive experiments using abundant real-world datasets with LensKit implementation, we successfully demonstrate that our solution improves the performance of existing CF methods consistently and universally. Moreover, comparing with baseline methods, CSII can extract uninteresting items more carefully and cautiously, avoiding potential items inferred by mistake.},

  abstract = {Location-Based Services have become increasingly popular due to the prevalence of smart devices and location-sharing applications such as Facebook and Foursquare. The protection of people's sensitive location data in such applications is an important requirement. Conventional location privacy protection methods, however, such as manually defining privacy rules or asking users to make decisions each time they enter a new location may be overly complex, intrusive or unwieldy. An alternative is to use machine learning to predict people's privacy preferences and automatically configure settings. Model-based machine learning classifiers may be too computationally complex to be used in real-world applications, or suffer from poor performance when training data are insufficient. In this paper we propose a location-privacy recommender that can provide people with recommendations of appropriate location privacy settings through user-user collaborative filtering. Using a real-world location-sharing dataset, we show that the prediction accuracy of our scheme (73.08\%) is similar to the best performance of model-based classifiers (75.30\%), and at the same time causes fewer privacy leaks (11.75\% vs 12.70\%). Our scheme further outperforms model-based classifiers when there are insufficient training data. Since privacy preferences are innately private, we make our recommender privacy-aware by obfuscating people's preferences. Our results show that obfuscation leads to a minimal loss of prediction accuracy (0.76\%).}
