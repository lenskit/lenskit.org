title = "Comparing Fair Ranking Metrics",
author = "Raj, Amifa and Wood, Connor and Montoly, Ananda and Ekstrand, Michael D",
abstract = "Ranking is a fundamental aspect of recommender systems. However, ranked outputs can be susceptible to various biases; some of these may cause disadvantages to members of protected groups. Several metrics have been proposed to quantify the (un)fairness of rankings, but there has not been to date any direct comparison of these metrics. This complicates deciding what fairness metrics are applicable for specific scenarios, and assessing the extent to which metrics agree or disagree. In this paper, we describe several fair ranking metrics in a common notation, enabling direct comparison of their approaches and assumptions, and empirically compare them on the same experimental setup and data set. Our work provides a direct comparative analysis identifying similarities and differences of fair ranking metrics selected for our work.",

@ARTICLE{De_Pessemier2020-oq,
title = "Evaluating facial recognition services as interaction technique for recommender systems",
author = "De Pessemier, Toon and Coppens, Ine and Martens, Luc",
abstract = "Recommender systems are tools and techniques to assist users in the content selection process thereby coping with the problem of information overload. For recommender systems, user authentication and feedback gathering are of crucial importance. However, the typical user authentication with username / password and feedback method with a star rating system are not user friendly and often bypassed. This article proposes an alternative method for user authentication based on facial recognition and an automatic feedback gathering method by detecting various face characteristics such as emotions. We studied the use case of video watching. Photos made with the front-facing camera of a tablet, smartphone, or smart TV are used as input of a facial recognition service. The persons in front of the screen can be identified. During video watching, implicit feedback for the video content is automatically gathered through emotion recognition, attention measurements, and behavior analysis. An evaluation with a test panel showed that the recognized emotions are correlated with the user's star ratings and that happiness can be most accurately detected. So as the main contribution, this article indicates that emotion recognition might be used as an alternative feedback mechanism for recommender systems.",

author = "Narayan, A",
abstract = "Recommender systems designers believe that the system stands to benefit from the users rating items that do not have many ratings. However, the effect of this act of rating lesser known items on the user's recommendations is unknown. This leads to asking the question of whether these low popularity items affect the recommendations received by users. This work looks at the effect less popular items have on a user's recommendations and the prediction and recommendations metrics that quantify the quality of recommendations …",

author = "Wang, X and Kadioglu, S",
abstract = "Personalized Recommendation Systems require an effective method to balance exploration and exploitation. To learn effective strategies, user and item attributes are critical data sources to capture contextual information. In this paper, we first present an approach based on Bayesian Deep Learning to learn a compact representation of user and item attributes to guide exploitation. A key novelty of the approach lies in its ability to also capture the uncertainty associated with the model output to guide exploration. We then show how to further boost exploration by incorporating model uncertainty with that of data uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of accuracy in recommendations as well as its performance in an online setting.",

@ARTICLE{Ng2020-gf,
title = "{CBRec}: a book recommendation system for children using the matrix factorisation and content-based filtering approaches",
author = "Ng, Yiu-Kai",
abstract = "Promoting good reading habits among children is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students' development as learners and members of the society. Unfortunately, very few (children) websites or online applications recommend books to children, even though they can play a significant role in encouraging children to read. Given that a few popular book websites suggest books to children based on the popularity of books or rankings on books, they are not customised/personalised for each individual user and likely recommend books that users do not want or like. We have integrated the matrix factorisation approach and the content-based approach, in addition to predicting the grade levels of books, to recommend books for children. Recent research works have demonstrated that a hybrid approach, which combines different filtering approaches, is more effective in making recommendations. Conducted empirical study has verified the effectiveness of our proposed children book recommendation system.",

booktitle = "Proceedings of the 29th {ACM} International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management",
author = "Diaz, Fernando and Mitra, Bhaskar and Ekstrand, Michael D and Biega, Asia J and Carterette, Ben",
abstract = "We introduce the concept of expected exposure as the average attention ranked items receive from users over repeated samples of the same query. Furthermore, we advocate for the adoption of the principle of equal expected exposure: given a fixed information need, no item receive more or less expected exposure compared to any other item of the same relevance grade. We argue that this principle is desirable for many retrieval objectives and scenarios, including topical diversity and fair ranking. Leveraging user models from existing retrieval metrics, we propose a general evaluation methodology based on expected exposure and draw connections to related metrics in information retrieval evaluation. Importantly, this methodology relaxes classic information retrieval assumptions, allowing a system, in response to a query, to produce a distribution over rankings instead of a single fixed ranking. We study the behavior of the expected exposure metric and stochastic rankers across a variety of information access conditions, including ad hoc retrieval and recommendation. We believe that measuring and optimizing expected exposure metrics using randomization opens a new area for retrieval algorithm development and progress.",

booktitle = "Proceedings of the 6th Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems",
author = "Pessemier, Toon De and Coppens, Ine and Martens, Luc",
abstract = "User authentication and feedback gathering are crucial aspects for recommender systems. The most common implementations, a username / password login and star rating systems, require user interaction and a cognitive effort from the user. As a result, users opt to save their password in the interface and optional feedback with a star rating system is often skipped, especially for applications such as video watching in a home environment. In this article, we propose an alternative method for user authentication based on facial recognition and an automatic feedback gathering method by detecting various face characteristics. Using facial recognition with a camera in a tablet, smartphone, or smart TV, the persons in front of the screen can be identified in order to link video watching sessions to their user profile. During video watching, implicit feedback is automatically gathered through emotion recognition, attention measurements, and behavior analysis. An emotion fingerprint, which is defined as a unique spectrum of expected emotions for a video scene, is compared to the recognized emotions in order to estimate the experience of a user while watching. An evaluation with a test panel showed that happiness can be most accurately detected and the recognized emotions are correlated with the user's star rating.",
