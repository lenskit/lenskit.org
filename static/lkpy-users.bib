title = "What is the Value of Rating Obscure Items? An Analysis of the Effect of {Less-Popular} Items on Recommendation Quality",
author = "Narayan, A",
abstract = "Recommender systems designers believe that the system stands to benefit from the users rating items that do not have many ratings. However, the effect of this act of rating lesser known items on the user's recommendations is unknown. This leads to asking the question of whether these low popularity items affect the recommendations received by users. This work looks at the effect less popular items have on a user's recommendations and the prediction and recommendations metrics that quantify the quality of recommendations …",

@ARTICLE{Ng2020-gf,
title = "{CBRec}: a book recommendation system for children using the matrix factorisation and content-based filtering approaches",
author = "Ng, Yiu-Kai",
abstract = "Promoting good reading habits among children is essential, given the enormous influence of reading on students' development as learners and members of the society. Unfortunately, very few (children) websites or online applications recommend books to children, even though they can play a significant role in encouraging children to read. Given that a few popular book websites suggest books to children based on the popularity of books or rankings on books, they are not customised/personalised for each individual user and likely recommend books that users do not want or like. We have integrated the matrix factorisation approach and the content-based approach, in addition to predicting the grade levels of books, to recommend books for children. Recent research works have demonstrated that a hybrid approach, which combines different filtering approaches, is more effective in making recommendations. Conducted empirical study has verified the effectiveness of our proposed children book recommendation system.",

booktitle = "2019 {IEEE} 31st International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence ({ICTAI})",
author = "Wang, X and Kadioglu, S",
abstract = "Personalized Recommendation Systems require an effective method to balance exploration and exploitation. To learn effective strategies, user and item attributes are critical data sources to capture contextual information. In this paper, we first present an approach based on Bayesian Deep Learning to learn a compact representation of user and item attributes to guide exploitation. A key novelty of the approach lies in its ability to also capture the uncertainty associated with the model output to guide exploration. We then show how to further boost exploration by incorporating model uncertainty with that of data uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our approach in terms of accuracy in recommendations as well as its performance in an online setting.",
