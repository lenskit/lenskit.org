# Connect with LensKit

There are several ways you can connect with LensKit, communicate with other users and developers, and discuss the project:

-   [Follow us on Mastodon](https://recsys.social/@LensKit).  We post
    LensKit-related announcements and information, and love to hear what you're
    doing with LensKit.

-   [Join the mailing list on Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lenskit-recsys).
    This list is where we discuss LensKit development and answer questions
    about how to use LensKit.

-   [Contribute on GitHub](https://github.com/lenskit/lkpy/), where we
    have the source code and issue tracker.  We take new contributions via
    GitHub pull requests.
