# Research with LensKit

LensKit is intended to be particularly useful in recommender systems research.

If you use LensKit in published research, cite:

## Original LensKit (Java)

If you publish research that uses the old Java version of LensKit, cite:

<div class="citation" markdown="span">

and John T. Riedl. 2011. <a href="http://md.ekstrandom.net/research/pubs/lenskit"

For your convenience, here is the BibTeX:

~~~bibtex
@INPROCEEDINGS{LensKit,
    title = "Rethinking the Recommender Research Ecosystem: Reproducibility, Openness, and {LensKit}",
    booktitle = "Proceedings of the Fifth {ACM} Conference on Recommender Systems",
    author = "Ekstrand, Michael D and Ludwig, Michael and Konstan, Joseph A and Riedl, John T",
    publisher = "ACM",
    pages = "133--140",
    series = "RecSys '11",
    year =  2011,
    url = "http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2043932.2043958",
    conference = "RecSys '11",
    doi = "10.1145/2043932.2043958"
}

We would also appreciate it if you could send a PDF and citation for your article to <ekstrand@acm.org>, so we can know where all LensKit is being used.

LensKit has been used in a number of published papers.  In this list, we have attempted to collect published research that has used the LensKit software in some capacity.
